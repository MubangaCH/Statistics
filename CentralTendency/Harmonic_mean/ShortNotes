The harmonic mean is useful in situations involving rates and ratios. For example, to calculate the average speed a car travels at for the
same distance you could use the harmonic mean. Eg a car travels 100 miles at 70 mph from A to destination B and then back to A at 50 mph
you use the harmonic mean to calculate its average speed for the two trips.
Harmonic mean divides the total number of variables by the sum of each of their reciprocals
Harmonic mean = N/((1/a1) + (1/a2) +....(1/aN))
In this case harmonic mean = 2/((1/70) + (1/50))
