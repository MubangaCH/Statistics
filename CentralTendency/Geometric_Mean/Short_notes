The geometric mean is useful when calculating the average of data with different properties. 
For example you want to purchase a car with different horsepowers and prices. One can has horsepower of 350 and costs $30000
while the other has horsepower of 400 and costs $40000. If you want to get value for your money, you may want to compute the 
geometric mean of each car by multiplying the price of each car with its horsepower and taking the squareroot. Eg
G.mean of car 1 = sqrt(500 * 300000)
G.mean of car 2 =sqrt (400 * 400000)
G.mean = Nroot(a1 * a2 * ....aN
