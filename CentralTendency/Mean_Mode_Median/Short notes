 The mean is calculated by dividing the sum of all the variables by the total number of variables
 The median is calculated by getting the middle number of a sorted list of variables. 
 If the total number of variables is even, the average of the two middle numbers is obtained
 The mode is calculated by picking out the variables occuring with the highest freguency. 
 This code can calculate mode from multimodal data
